SOC for creating a filter "module"

I recognize at this point that I probably want a complete module to contain a filter. It will be like any standard filter,
so here's the design:
    audio input
    lowpass out
    highpass out
    mixed out?
    frequency setting - such that a knob could control
    resonance (Q)
    freq. cv in
    resonance cv in
    
    which filter to use? FilterStateVariable
    
    for the frequency handling...
        create an Add circuit
            inputA is the big knob set freq
            inputB is the FCV input (LFO)
            
        upstream of the Add we need an amplifier, something to boost the incoming LFO from 1 to the range of LFO effect
        - Multiply
        FCV in -> Multiply -> Add
        Freq. ----------------^
