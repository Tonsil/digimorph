Sequencer

I want to try out making a sequencer, so working out an approach.
UI will have a bunch of stuff, eventually, but we can start off with the start/stop functionality.

The back end, because of the way JSyn works, should do something like:

    Sequence exists as a list of events, notes and anything else.
    Sequence may be looped indefinitely.
    Eventually, there could be multiple loops of different durations, which might be interesting.
    
    Scheduler has to read events from sequence(s) and plop them into the queue.
    Queue has to be loaded up enough in advance that the events there will carry through until the next time the preload occurs.
    Each preload cycle will load up more data from last read point until end point, == now to end of preload window.
    When playback is stopped, it should do so immediately, noting the stop point and flushing the loaded queue.
    When playback is started, there will have to be a small amount of lag time before 1st event to ensure that events have a 
    chance to get set.
    
UI
    stop button
    play button
    loop icon?
